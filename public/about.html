<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Simon, the older son of a fisherman named Jonah, was born in Bethsaida, where he grew up with his younger brother, Andrew, with whom he's very close. The family eventually moved to Capernaum, and when the boys became teenagers and finished Hebrew School, their father taught them how to fish by having them sit down and watch.

  Eventually their father would trust them to go fishing on their own, and on the point where they made their own mistakes. They became known among the other fishermen in Capernaum including one of the lead merchants in the city, Zebedee.
  
  Simon met Eden, the sister of fellow fishermen Jehoshaphat and Abrahim, and soon took her hand in marriage.</p>

<p>Matthew, the son of a leatherworker named Alphaeus, was born in Capernaum. As a child he attended Hebrew school like all the other boys, showing unusual promise in literacy and mathematics, enabling him to be a bookkeeper's apprentice when he was eight while his Torah studies were put on hiatus.

  Before Matthew could begin studying Torah again, he was shown at the age of thirteen to the Roman Magistrate, who was so impressed by his intelligence he offered Matthew a very lucrative job if he chose to work for Rome as a tax collector, which he accepted. As a result, he was ostracized by his family and forced to buy his own house. Surrounded by only poor servants and Roman guards, Matthew lost the chance to study Torah and have real friends..</p>

<p>I'm just a big fan of the chosen series.</p>
